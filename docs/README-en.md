## What does this bot do?

- If $(what-you-wanted) is stock, sends you telegram message with direct checkout link!
- It $(what-you-wanted) is out of stock, you can select to send telegram message without telegram message alert or ether not to send message.

## Why did you make this? There's an alert for this in coupang!
- Sometimes the alert doesn't come correctly or on time.
